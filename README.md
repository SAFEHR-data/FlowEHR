# ðŸŒº FlowEHR
FlowEHR is a safe, secure &amp; cloud-native development &amp; deployment platform for digital healthcare research &amp; innovation.

> **Warning**
> This repository is a _work in progress_. We're working towards a v0.1.0 release


## Getting started

This repository includes a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to avoid "it works on my machine" scenarios. 

Simply clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/FlowEHR
```
Then open it in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and, when prompted, click to "Open in Container" (make sure Docker is running on your host first). This will create a container with all the required packages for developing this repository.

## Configuring

Local deployment (i.e. non CI/CD) requires a `config.yaml` file in the root. Copy the `config.sample.yaml` file and save it as `config.yaml`.

```bash
cp config.sample.yaml config.yaml
```

Then edit `config.yaml` and specify the following values:

- `suffix` - a suffix to apply to all deployed resources (i.e. `flowehr-uclh`)
- `environment` - a unique name for your environment (i.e. `jgdev`)
- `location` - the [Azure region](https://azuretracks.com/2021/04/current-azure-region-names-reference/) you wish to deploy resources to
- `arm_subscription_id` - the [Azure subscription id](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id) you wish to deploy to

For the full reference of possible configuration values, see the [config schema file](./config_schema.json).

## Deploying
### Locally

1. Log in to Azure

    Run `az login` to authenticate to Azure

2. Run `make all`

    To bootstrap Terraform, and deploy all infrastructure and apps, run

    ```bash
    make all
    ```

    Alternatively, you can deploy just infrastructure:

    ```bash
    make infrastructure
    ```

    You can also deploy individual infrastructure modules, as well as destroy and other operations. To see all options:

    ```bash
    make help
    ```

### CI (GitHub Actions)

CI deployment workflows are run in [Github environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment). These should
be created in a private repository created from this template repository.

1. Create a service principal

    CI deployments require a service principal with access to deploy resources
    in the subscription. One will be required for each subscription into which the
    environment deploys. Create one with:

    ```bash
    subscription_id=<e.g 00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000>
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "sp-flowehr-cicd" --role Owner --scopes "/subscriptions/${subscription_id}"
    ```

    The output will be used in the next step.


2. Create and populate a GitHub environment

    Add an environment called `Infra-Test` with the following secrets:

    - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: json containing the credentials of the service principal in the format:

        ```json
        {
            "clientId": "xxx",
            "clientSecret": "xxx",
            "tenantId": "xxx",
            "subscriptionId": "xxx",
            "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "management.azure.com"
        }
        ```

    - `SUFFIX`: Suffix used for naming resources. Must be unique to this repository e.g. `abcd`
    - `LOCATION`: Name of an Azure location e.g. `uksouth`. These can be listed with `az account list-locations -o table`
    - `ENVIRONMENT`: Name of the environment e.g. `dev`, also used to name resources
    - `DEVCONTAINER_ACR_NAME`: Name of the Azure Container Registry to use for the devcontainer build. This may or may not exist. e.g. `flowehrmgmtacr`


3. Run `Deploy Infra-Test`

    Trigger a deployment using a workflow dispatch trigger on the `Actions` tab.

## Common issues

### Inconsistent dependency lock file

When deploying locally, you might encounter an error message from Terraform saying you have inconsistent lock files. This is likely due to an update to some of the provider configurations and lock files upstream, that when pulled down to your machine, might not match the cached providers you have locally from a previous deployment.

The easiest fix is to run `make tf-init`, which will re-initialise these caches in all of the Terraform modules to match the lock files.
