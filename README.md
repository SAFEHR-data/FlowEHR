    ```
</details>


### CI (GitHub Actions)

CI deployment workflows are run in [Github environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment). These should
be created in a private repository created from this template repository.

    <summary>Create a service principal</summary>

    CI deployments require a service principal with access to deploy resources
    in the subscription. Follow the steps above and then run

    ```bash
    make auth
    ```

    The output will be used in the next step.

    "subscriptionId": "xxx",
    "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "management.azure.com"
    }
    ```

    - `PREFIX`: Prefix used for naming resources. Must be unique to this repository e.g. `abcd`
    - `LOCATION`: Name of an Azure location e.g. `uksouth`. These can be listed with `az account list-locations -o table`
    - `ENVIRONMENT`: Name of the envrionment e.g. `dev`, also used to name resources
