This module deploys all resources that are required by FlowEHR if Unity Catalog is enabled.

Deployment of this module relies on having metastore_id provided, amongst other things. Unity Catalog Metastore must be deployed once per region per organisation. This deployment can either be done at the same time as deployment of this module, or in a separate resource group.
