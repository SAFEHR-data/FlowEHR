This module creates Azure resources supporting Unity Catalog Metastore. 

A Metastore is a top-level container for data in Unity Catalog. It stores data and metadata for Managed tables, and metadata only for External tables.

Only one Metastore can be created for each region in which your organisation operates.

More information can be found here: [Unity Catalog on Azure](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs/guides/unity-catalog-azure).
